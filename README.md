# Valorant Homepage Clone (Static)

This is my first web development project — a **static clone** of the official [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/) homepage. Built using only **HTML** and **CSS**, this project helped me understand the fundamentals of webpage structure, styling, and UI layout.

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- HTML5
- CSS3

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Structuring HTML elements
- Applying CSS styles and fonts
- Working with images and layout
- Building header, hero, and button sections

## 🚫 Note
This project is **not responsive** and was created to practice and improve my basic web development skills. Future versions may include responsiveness and interactivity.

## 📌 Purpose
- Practice HTML and CSS layout
- Recreate a real-world UI for learning
- Use in portfolio as a beginner project
